# Summer Pack Dev Repo (Name to be decided)
Simple setup:
## Install packwiz
https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz/actions/runs/14635814142
Go there, scroll down and download the right executable for your computer, then run it using the command
`packwiz curseforge export`
That will give you a zip file, then you can import it to prismlauncher.
